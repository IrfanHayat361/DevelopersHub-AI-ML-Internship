# AI/ML Internship Task – Dataset Exploration and Visualization

## Objective
To explore and visualize a structured dataset in order to understand data distributions, feature relationships, and overall data quality before applying machine learning models.

## Dataset
- **Iris Dataset**
- 150 samples, 4 numerical features, 3 classes
- Loaded using seaborn and processed with pandas

## Techniques Used
- Data inspection with pandas (`head`, `info`, `describe`)
- Data visualization using matplotlib and seaborn
- Scatter plots, histograms, box plots, and pair plots

## Key Findings
- Dataset contains no missing values and is well-balanced
- Petal length and petal width provide the clearest separation between species
- Setosa is easily distinguishable, while Versicolor and Virginica overlap
- Exploratory analysis confirms suitability for classification tasks

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
