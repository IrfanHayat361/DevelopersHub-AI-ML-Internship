# Task-01: Iris Dataset Exploration and Visualization

## Objective
Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on the Iris dataset to understand feature distributions, relationships, and class separability before applying machine learning models.

---

## Dataset
- Name: Iris Dataset
- Samples: 150
- Features:
  - Sepal Length
  - Sepal Width
  - Petal Length
  - Petal Width
- Target Classes:
  - Setosa
  - Versicolor
  - Virginica
- Source: Loaded using Seaborn library

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## Workflow
1. Load and inspect the dataset
2. Perform basic data exploration (`head`, `info`, `describe`)
3. Check for missing values and class balance
4. Visualize feature distributions using histograms and box plots
5. Analyze feature relationships using scatter plots and pair plots
6. Identify patterns useful for classification modeling

---

## Results
- Dataset is clean with no missing values
- Classes are evenly distributed
- Petal length and petal width provide strong class separation
- Setosa is clearly distinguishable, while Versicolor and Virginica show overlap

---

## Key Learnings
- Importance of EDA before model training
- Visual techniques for understanding feature relationships
- Identifying discriminative features for classification tasks

---

## Limitations
- Analysis is limited to structured numerical features
- No feature engineering or modeling performed in this task
- Dataset is small and primarily educational

---

## Conclusion
This task establishes a strong foundation for machine learning by validating data quality and uncovering meaningful patterns. The insights gained directly support downstream classification model development.
