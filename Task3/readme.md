#Task-3: Heart Disease Prediction

## Objective
Build and compare machine learning models to predict whether a patient is at risk of heart disease using structured medical data.

---

## Dataset
- **Heart Disease UCI Dataset**
- Source: Kaggle
- Type: Tabular medical dataset
- Target variable:
  - `HeartDisease` (0 = No disease, 1 = Disease)

---

## Models Implemented
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier

---

## Workflow
1. Load and inspect dataset
2. Handle categorical variables using encoding
3. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Split data into training and testing sets
5. Scale features where required
6. Train Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models
7. Evaluate models using:
   - Accuracy
   - Confusion Matrix
   - ROC Curve & AUC
8. Perform cross-validation
9. Compare model performance
10. Analyze feature importance

---

## Model Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- ROC-AUC
- Cross-validation accuracy

---

## Results Summary
- Logistic Regression performed better on unseen data
- Decision Tree showed higher variance and mild overfitting
- Logistic Regression produced a smoother ROC curve

---

## Key Learnings
- Handling real-world medical datasets
- Binary classification modeling
- Importance of evaluation beyond accuracy
- Trade-offs between interpretable and flexible models
