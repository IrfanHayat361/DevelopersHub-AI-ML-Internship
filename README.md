# AI/ML Internship Projects – DevelopersHub

This repository contains a collection of projects and tasks completed as part of my **AI/ML Internship at DevelopersHub**.  
The work here focuses on building a strong foundation in data analysis, machine learning, and applied problem-solving using industry-relevant tools and workflows.

Each project demonstrates a structured approach, starting from data understanding and exploration, followed by appropriate modeling or analysis where applicable.

## Repository Structure
Each task or project is organized in its own folder and typically includes:

- A **Jupyter Notebook** containing:
  - Problem statement and objective  
  - Data exploration and visualization  
  - Analysis, insights, and conclusions  
- Supporting files (datasets, if required)
- Clear Markdown explanations for readability
